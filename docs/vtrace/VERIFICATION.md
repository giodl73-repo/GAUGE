# Verification Plan

## Scope

Repo: GAUGE

VTRACE adoption scope: define verification methods and command levels for GAUGE's
requirements. The initial VTRACE baseline was authored before implementation;
the six-crate workspace now exists and the June 2026 implementation wave has
closed. This file records current command evidence while preserving residual
limits: corpus coverage is narrow, most dimensions are intentionally empty, and
public findings remain research outputs rather than engineering studies,
timetables, procurement plans, advocacy briefs, or FRA/Amtrak/state-DOT/
host-railroad endorsements.

## Verification Matrix

| Req ID | Method | Command / Inspection | Expected Evidence | Result | Evidence Pointer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-001 | inspection / demonstration | `cargo run -p gauge-cli -- gap --input corpus` | a documented regeneration path with labels preserved | passed | EVID-001 |
| REQ-002 | inspection / review | inspect evidence labels on corpus quantities | every material quantity carries an evidence label | passed | EVID-002 |
| REQ-003 | citation audit | inspect corpus source ids against `data/sources.md` | every cited quantity resolves to a registry source or is labelled | passed | EVID-003 |
| REQ-004 | schema check / inspection | validate corpus frontmatter keys against schema | stable station/segment/corridor id present; labels are not keys | passed | EVID-004 |
| REQ-005 | gate / data inspection | cargo tests for unidentified/uncited hold or reject paths | unidentified/uncited rows held, not promoted | passed | EVID-005 |
| REQ-006 | calibration record | inspect rubric version + calibration rationale | rubric changes are versioned and justified | pass_with_risk | EVID-006 (v0, provisional) |
| REQ-007 | analysis / inspection | inspect typed dispatch-basis surfaces and tests | dedicated vs shared-host basis named on each claim | passed | EVID-007 |
| REQ-008 | gap inspection / review | `gauge-cli gap` plus gap tests | null/empty regions recorded; systemic deficit classified | passed | EVID-008 |
| REQ-009 | review inspection | confirm parliament + editorial gate ran on a promoted claim | review records exist with dispositions | pass_with_risk | EVID-009 (panel exists, not yet exercised on a corpus claim) |
| REQ-010 | role review | confirm ridership/trip-time/reliability/modal/equity/host lenses represented | stakeholder lenses present in `.roles/` and applied | pass_with_risk | EVID-010 (`.roles/` panel built) |
| REQ-011 | editorial review | inspect public claims for scope boundary | outputs framed as research/tooling/conceptual design | pass_with_risk | EVID-011 (`README`/`PRODUCT_PLAN`/`MISSION` non-goals) |
| REQ-012 | git inspection | `git status --short`; confirm no TRACKER pointer touched | GAUGE changes stay in the child repo | passed | EVID-012 |
| REQ-013 | wave ledger / review | inspect wave ledger + pulses for one-at-a-time discipline | each VTRACE stage settled to a fixed point in sequence | passed | EVID-013 |
| REQ-014 | schema check / inspection | validate `tier` + `sla` frontmatter and tier model | every corridor classified T1–T4 with declared SLA | passed | EVID-014 |
| REQ-015 | gate / gap inspection | tier-SLA conformance checks and DIM-13 empty-region reporting | tier-SLA shortfalls reported before adequacy claimed | pass_with_risk | EVID-015 (DIM-13 currently empty in first corpus) |
| REQ-DOC-001 | doc QA | `proof check .` | markdown QA clean across repo docs | passed | EVID-DOC-001 |

## Commands

```powershell
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo run -p gauge-cli -- --help
cargo run -p gauge-cli -- gap --input corpus
git diff --check
```

## Validation Levels

| Level | Purpose | Commands / Evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | Fast crate/doc sanity for the active stage. | package tests and `git diff --check` | passed |
| L1 | Full repo confidence before push. | fmt, clippy, workspace tests, CLI help | passed |
| L2 | Readiness proof before a public claim. | gap replay + role review + finding scope review | pass_with_risk |

## Evidence Ledger

| Evidence ID | Type | Path / Command | Covers | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EVID-DOC-001 | report | `proof check .` (0 errors) | REQ-DOC-001 | passed |
| EVID-012 | command | `git status --short` (standalone child repo) | REQ-012 | passed |
| EVID-013 | review | `context/waves/2026-06-25-vtrace-foundation/` ledger + pulses | REQ-013 | passed |
| EVID-009..011 | review | `.roles/` panel present and applied in stage reviews | REQ-009/010/011 | pass_with_risk |
| EVID-001..008, 014, 015 | command/review | fmt, clippy, tests, CLI help, gap replay | REQ-001..008/014/015 | passed/pass_with_risk |

## Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Corpus coverage is narrow. | The first finding covers 12 US corridors and DIM-07 only. | label as first-slice evidence; do not generalize to all rail adequacy |
| DIM-01..06 and DIM-08..13 are empty in the replay. | Empty dimensions can be mistaken for zeros or passing scores. | keep `EmptyRegion` artifacts explicit |
| Public finding may be overused. | A research signal could be cited as engineering, timetable, procurement, advocacy, or endorsement authority. | keep public scope boundary and role review before promotion |

## Role Review Notes

| Role Lens | Verification Impact | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| V&V lens | Methods are credible and mapped 1:1 to requirements; unrun checks are `pending`, not faked. | pass |
| Citation Auditor | Evidence pointers are real (commands run) or explicitly future. | pass |
| Numeracy Checker | The one quantity (0 errors) is a real command result. | pass |
| Scope Keeper | Verification stays at method/result level; no corridor scored. | pass |

Fixed-point note: no actionable finding required a change. The plan honestly
separates verified-now (process/doc) from pending (implementation). No unresolved
critical/major finding.
